 What is Dynamic Programming?
Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and saving the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

Itâ€™s usually used in optimization problems (e.g. maximize/minimize/count ways).

ðŸ”¹ When to Use DP?
Ask yourself:

Can I break the problem into subproblems?

Do the subproblems overlap (get repeated)?

Can I store and reuse results (memoize)?

If YES to all â†’ You can use DP.

ðŸ”¹ DP Types
1. Top-down (Memoization)
Recursion + Caching

Start from the original problem and solve smaller subproblems as needed

js
Copy
Edit
// Example: Fibonacci
const dp = {};
function fib(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  if (dp[n] !== undefined) return dp[n];
  return dp[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
2. Bottom-up (Tabulation)
Iterative

Solve all subproblems first, then build the final solution from them

js
Copy
Edit
function fib(n) {
  const dp = [0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
ðŸ”¹ Common Patterns
0/1 Knapsack

Subset Sum

Fibonacci Sequence

Longest Common Subsequence

Edit Distance

Minimum Path Sum in Grid

Unique Paths

Partition Equal Subset Sum

ðŸ”¹ Steps to Solve DP Problems
1. Define the State
What parameters define a subproblem?

e.g., dp[i][j] = result using first i items with weight j

2. State Transition (Recurrence)
How do you build larger solutions from smaller ones?

e.g., dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j - arr[i]]

3. Base Case(s)
Whatâ€™s the smallest subproblem, and what's the answer?

e.g., dp[0][0] = true

4. Final Answer
Where is the result in the table?

e.g., return dp[n][target]

ðŸ”¹ Real World Analogy
Imagine calculating all the ways to climb stairs where you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Without DP: You try every possibility recursively, recalculating the same subproblems over and over.

With DP: You store results for each step and reuse them, making it super fast.

TL;DR Summary

Concept	Meaning
DP	Break problems into overlapping subproblems
Memoization	Recursive + cache
Tabulation	Iterative + table
Goal	Avoid repeated work, optimize performance
